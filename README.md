# FL4-CS131-04-02-CustFunc
Instructor-provided program to introduce the setup and usage of custom functions

Learned:
- What formatting is necessary for possible functional relations
- Custom functions can be vital to condensing a main batch of code by referring back to custom function that's called many times, instead of pasting all of its code every time it's needed
